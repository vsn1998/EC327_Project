All of the GoogleMaps files are necessary to use Google Maps and location services. Each file has comments in the code itself to explain
its functionality, please read through it. Currently, it is set to output the latitude and longitude of the user and show a marker on the map
for where they are. It will update every 20 seconds (which can be changed).
