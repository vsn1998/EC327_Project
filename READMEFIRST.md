All of the GoogleMaps files are necessary to use Google Maps and location services. Each file has comments in the code itself to explain
its functionality, please read through it. Currently, it is set to output the latitude and longitude of the user and show a marker on the map
for where they are. It will update every 20 seconds (which can be changed). 

Before using those files, ensure that you have Google play services installed in the SDK manager, and you may also need to obtain another API key to use (I left mine in for you guys). If running on Android studio emulator, the map may not show up or say that Google Maps is having issues with Google play services. So long as the latitude and longitude are working, then the map should work on an actual android device. 

*Update: running the Google Maps files will allow you to see the address and the map marker 

The MainPage files all pertain to the first page the user sees when opening the app
